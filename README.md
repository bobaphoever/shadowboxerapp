# shadowboxerapp
An Android application version of my Mayweather Combo Shadowboxing web app. It is built in Android Studio using Kotlin and XML; it is an extremely simple application with a start button to audibly announce the combinations every 1.4 seconds for the user to shadowbox and a stop button to stop or pause the function.
